## Description

The [Foundation for Endangered Languages](http://www.ogmios.org/) exists to support, enable and assist the documentation, protection and promotion of endangered languages worldwide. One of the possibilities to accomplish this is to bring specialists together in a Regional Interest Group with representatives of certain endangered languages communities in a specific area of the world. The aim of the conference in Murmansk is to initiate such a group specifically for Northern Eurasia. This group will be devoted to the study of and work with the endangered language communities in the arctic and subarctic regions between Fennoscandia and the Pacific Rim. At present the numerous and linguistically diverse indigenous languages in this area are highly vulnerable and may even face extinction if no effective measures are taken soon to ensure their better documentation, preservation and revitalization. 

Language documentation, language planning and language teaching are different endeavors belonging the separate subfields of applied linguistics. In the case of endangered indigenous languages, however, there is considerable overlap often as a result of the scarce material and personal resources for carrying out research, which is most typically bundled in relatively few projects, academic institutions or scientific networks. On the other hand, consistent collaboration across these fields of research has already produced valuable synergy effects resulting in methodological and theoretical advances in each single field. 

The conference focuses on the applied character of research on and for indigenous languages. We invite papers presenting topics on endangered language documentation, preservation and revitalization, in particular in the northern Eurasian area. Papers comparing the experience of local researchers in collaboration with specialists in the fields of language documentation, language planning and language teaching are especially welcome. 

The symposium is organized as a result of collaboration between academic institutions based in Russia and the Netherlands: specifically the Murmansk Arctic State University and the Mercator Research Centre of the Fryske Akademy, the Department of Frisian Language and Culture and the Centre for Russian Studies of Groningen University. In this way further international relations between Murmansk and Groningen can hopefully be established in the future and the event can thus also contribute to the official city partnership between Murmansk and Groningen.

Conference contributions can be in Russian or English and will consist of 30 minute paper presentations followed by 10 minutes of discussion. All abstracts submitted by e-mail to the organizers by the end of August 2016 will be considered. If we receive more abstracts than available time slots during the conference the organizers and members of the program committee will make a selection based on the quality of the proposed papers. Abstracts should not be longer than 500 words, excluding references. 

On the basis of the accepted abstracts and a few invited presentations the conference program will be prepared and further details will be provided in fall 2016.
